# Sync-V2

Inspired by a class project that was inspired by a tik tok. 

Imagine that you’re sitting in the front of an uber on your way home from a fun night out in the vibrant nightlife of your city. You’ve decided to do uber pool obviously because you spent just a little too much money. So there are three strangers in the back of the uber-who like you are coming back from a night out. 

As the drive begins, the uber hands you the aux cord -you’re in front of course and now a dawning terror comes upon you-. YOU have to select the music for the ride home.. Meaning you're in the hot seat, eyes and pressure on you to produce songs that can carry the mood for you and the strangers you don’t know too well. 

Luckily, you’ve got Sync, an app that takes the aux cord from you and gives it to everybody in the car by aggregating everybody’s music preferences and creating a curated playlist of songs you’ll all enjoy. No more nervousness and fear of scrutiny, just vibes and three new friends.
