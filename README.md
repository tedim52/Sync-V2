# Sync-V2

Inspired by a class project that was inspired by a tik tok. 

Wouldn’t it be nice to have a playlist that combines music that everyone will like? With Sync, you can make sure that you’re playing the right song for the right group of people, so that no matter what song you play, everyone will like it.

Sync is a web app that will allow music listeners to “sync” their music preferences with their friends to create playlists of songs everyone enjoys listening to. Sync attempts to venture into untapped potential for social music discovery by bringing people together through music.

Planning to move to mobile.
